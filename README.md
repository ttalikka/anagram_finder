# anagram_finder
Finds anagrams and shorter permutations of a word

Defaults to a random 8 letter word found on the wordlist. You can also pass a custom word (or just a sequence of characters) or a length of a word as a parameter.

Usage:
```
./ana.py
./ana.py nakkivene
./ana.py 10
python3 ana.py
```

Try to keep the word length at 10 characters or less, as permutations are quite heavy to calculate.
